This project connects people and AI. Please keep all interactions respectful and constructive.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

- **Search Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please search `https://github.com/nishal21/Ultraclaw/issues` to see if it has already been reported.
- **Create a Detailed Issue**: If you find a new bug, please provide as much detail as possible, including your OS, Rust version, and reproduction steps.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- **Feature Requests**: Open an issue with the label `enhancement`. Describe the feature you'd like to see and why it would be useful.
- **Architectural Proposals**: For major changes (e.g., swapping the database engine, adding a new protocol), please open a "RFC" (Request for Comments) issue first to discuss the design.

### Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the Repo**: Click the "Fork" button on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3.  **Commit Changes**: `git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`
4.  **Push to Branch**: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
5.  **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and click "New Pull Request".

## Development Setup

1.  **Install Rust**: Ensure you have the latest stable Rust toolchain installed (`rustup update`).
2.  **Dependencies**:
    - **Windows**: Make sure you have the MSVC build tools installed.
    - **Linux**: You may need `libssl-dev`, `pkg-config`, and `libsqlite3-dev`.
3.  **Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your keys.
4.  **Test**: Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` before submitting your PR.

## Style Guide

- **Rustfmt**: We use standard `rustfmt`. Please run `cargo fmt` before committing.
- **Clippy**: We aim for zero warnings. Run `cargo clippy` and fix any issues.
- **Comments**: Document public structs and functions using `///` doc comments.
